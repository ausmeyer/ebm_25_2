Slide 4: Part 1: Measurement That Matters (Reliability & Validity)

Slide 5: Clinical Question — Reliability vs Validity

A physician is meeting with a group of fellows for their weekly research symposium, and the topic of
  discussion is reliability and validity. They discuss a scenario regarding a hospital that is testing a new
  depression screening tool. One of the goals is to compare the use of a tool between residents and attending
  physicians, and evaluate the degree to which the 2 groups independently score patients positive for
  depression.  Of the following, this scenario refers to the research concept of A.content validity B.internal
  consistency reliability C.inter-rater reliability * D.predictive validity

Slide 6: Answer & Explanation — Reliability vs Validity

- Correct Answer: inter-rater reliability
- Key Points:
  - Reliability is the consistency (repeatability) of scores (eg, you get the same temperature measurement
  - with repeated tests).
  - Validity  describes whether a test or instrument actually measures what is intended (eg, a temporal
  - thermometer measures the core body temperature).
- Visual suggestion: Graphic: three mini‑panels showing test–retest, internal consistency (α), and inter‑rater agreement.

Slide 7: Clinical Question — Generalizability (External Validity)

A hospitalist works at a large, urban hospital that serves a diverse pediatric patient population with a high
  burden of severe asthma and atopic disease. For an upcoming journal club, the hospitalist division will review
  a recently published randomized controlled trial. The trial concludes that a new medication for asthma
  exacerbations, “BtrBreth,” improves asthma symptoms and decreases length of hospital stay as compared to
  standard asthma therapy. The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted at 20 small pediatric hospitals
  in rural England with a total sample size of 1,500 patients. The researchers included children with
  intermittent asthma admitted for an asthma exacerbation and excluded any with persistent asthma, allergies,
  eczema, or other comorbidities. Of the following, the application of this study to the hospitalist’s patients
  is MOST limited by a lack of A.causality B.generalizability * C.internal validity D.power

Slide 8: Answer & Explanation — Generalizability (External Validity)

- Correct Answer: generalizability
- Key Points:
  - Generalizability (external validity) is the degree to which a research study’s results can be applied to
  - other populations and settings.
  - Internal validity evaluates the causal relationship of variables in a particular research study.
- Visual suggestion: Matrix: Internal Validity (low→high) × External Validity (low→high) with the study placed in a quadrant.

Slide 9: Part 2: Hypothesis Testing in the Wild

Slide 10: Clinical Question — Interpreting a p‑value (When to Reject H₀)

Investigators in a recent study assessed admission rates for acute croup. They hypothesized that there would
  be a significant difference in admission rates among children who received one treatment with nebulized
  epinephrine compared with children who received multiple treatments of nebulized epinephrine. They sought to
  detect a difference of 20% in admission rates with a predefined α  of .05 and 80% power to reach statistical
  significance. Using a large inpatient database, they identified 80,000 children who received one dose of
  nebulized epinephrine and 8,000 children who received more than one dose of nebulized epinephrine for acute
  croup. Admission rates were 10% in the former group and 70% in the latter group ( P =.01).  Of the following,
  the statement that BEST reflects the results of this study is A.multiple doses of epinephrine is a leading
  cause of admission for croup B.the null hypothesis regarding difference in admission rates should be rejected
  * C.the odds of admission were 7 times higher with multiple doses of epinephrine D.the study was underpowered
  to find a significant difference between the groups

Slide 11: Answer & Explanation — Interpreting a p‑value (When to Reject H₀)

- Correct Answer: the null hypothesis regarding difference in admission rates should be rejected
- Key Points:
  - The P value is the probability that an outcome at least as extreme is observed if the null hypothesis is
  - true.
  - Obtaining a result with a  P value of less than α  = 0.05 (5%) does not guarantee that the null hypothesis
  - is wrong, since a type I error (or false positive error) may still have occurred.
- Visual suggestion: Curve under H₀ with shaded tail area labeled ‘p = P(Data|H₀)’; note that p is not effect size.

Slide 12: Clinical Question — Power & Type II Error (β)

A clinical randomized controlled trial is performed to test the efficacy of a new type of corticosteroid
  inhaler as compared with “usual care” in preventing exacerbations of asthma in children. Enough patients are
  enrolled to provide a statistical power of 70%. Asthma severity, as measured by means of a validated score,
  was reduced by 35% in the intervention group and by 28% in the usual care group (p = .13). Using the common
  criterion of p < .05 as the cutoff point for significance, the authors conclude that there is no statistical
  difference between intervention and control groups. Of the following, the BEST estimate of the probability
  that the authors have reached their conclusion in error is A.5% B.7% C.13% D.30% *

Slide 13: Answer & Explanation — Power & Type II Error (β)

- Correct Answer: 30%
- Key Points:
  - The maximum probability of a type I error (inappropriately rejecting the null hypothesis) is determined
  - by the level of significance chosen for the hypothesis test ( α , usually .05).
  - The likelihood of type II error (inappropriately failing to reject the null hypothesis) is determined by the
  - power of the hypothesis test (power = 1 − β ).
- Visual suggestion: Simple power curve: power vs sample size; annotate α, effect size, variance levers.

Slide 14: Clinical Question — Type I vs Type II Errors (Failing to Reject H₀)

A new drug is being studied for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. It is a formulation of budesonide
  in individual pouches with a ready-made viscous solution that eliminates the need for the patient or parent to
  mix budesonide liquid vials before ingestion. The study randomized 50 children between the ages of 4 and 14
  years with eosinophilic esophagitis into 2 groups of medical therapies. They compared the results of
  esophageal biopsies from the diagnostic endoscopy to a subsequent endoscopy after 3 to 5 months on either
  formulation of budesonide. The study failed to find a significant difference in the number of eosinophils per
  HPF in those who used the new drug compound compared with those who used the budesonide vials mixed with a
  sucralose-based artificial sweetener. Of the following, the MOST accurate statement regarding this study is
  that A.the alternative hypothesis is supported B.it is possible that a type I error was committed C.it is
  possible that a type II error was committed * D.the null hypothesis is rejected

Slide 15: Answer & Explanation — Type I vs Type II Errors (Failing to Reject H₀)

- Correct Answer: it is possible that a type II error was committed
- Key Points:
  - A type II error (the probability of which is known as β ) occurs when the study fails to reject the null
  - hypothesis when there is indeed a difference between the two study groups.
  - A type I error (the probability of which is known as α ) incorrectly rejects the null hypothesis.
  - The power of a study is equal to 1 − β . The higher the power, the lower the possibility of a type II error,
- Visual suggestion: Decision tree: true/false state vs reject/fail to reject decisions; highlight Type I and Type II cells.

Slide 16: Part 3: Choosing the Right Statistical Test

Slide 17: Clinical Question — Choosing a Test: ANOVA for >2 Means

A pediatric nephrologist is studying factors that affect phosphorus levels in children with end-stage renal
  disease (ESRD). The nephrologist has collected laboratory data on all children with ESRD over a 5-year period
  from 6 dialysis centers serving a large, urban, diverse community. Fifty percent of the children were
  identified as Hispanic, 30% as African-American, 10% as white, and 10% did not have race/ethnicity information
  available.  Of the following, the BEST statistical approach to determine whether mean serum phosphorus levels
  differ by race/ethnicity in children with ESRD in this cohort is A.analysis of variance * B.Chi-square
  C.linear regression D.paired sample t test

Slide 18: Answer & Explanation — Choosing a Test: ANOVA for >2 Means

- Correct Answer: analysis of variance
- Key Points:
  - In general, variables can be categorical (eg, male, female) or continuous (eg, age, serum phosphorus).
  - Categorical variables can be dichotomous (eg, vaccinated or unvaccinated) or fall into more than two
  - categories (eg, race/ethnicity).
  - An analysis of variance is the best option for comparing mean values of more than 2 groups, assuming
- Visual suggestion: Boxplots for 4 groups with means; caption: ‘One‑way ANOVA compares mean differences across groups’.

Slide 19: Clinical Question — Choosing a Test: Chi‑Square for Proportions

A pediatric hospitalist is interested in studying asthma readmissions in her hospital. The hospital admits a
  large number of patients with asthma. She wants to compare the proportion of asthma readmissions in patients
  discharged with an asthma action plan compared to asthma patients who are discharged without an asthma action
  plan. Of the following, the MOST appropriate statistical test for this study is A.analysis of variance B.chi-
  square test * C.McNemar test D.paired t test

Slide 20: Answer & Explanation — Choosing a Test: Chi‑Square for Proportions

- Correct Answer: chi-square test
- Key Points:
  - Choosing an appropriate statistical method depends on the research question, study design, type of
  - variables, and the structure of the data.
  - Categorical variables are variables that have 2 or more groups.
  - A chi
- Visual suggestion: 2×2 table with observed counts and expected counts; footnote: use Fisher’s exact when small expected cell counts.

Slide 21: Part 4: Clinical Impact & Precision

Slide 22: Clinical Question — Effect Size in Practice: ARR → NNT

A new medication has been studied for use in patients with juvenile arthritis. In polyarticular rheumatoid
  factor–positive juvenile idiopathic arthritis, it has been shown to reduce the 2-year risk of joint erosion
  from 30% to 10%.  Of the following, the NUMBER of patients needed to be treated with this medication to
  decrease the number of children with joint erosion by 1 is A.3 B.5* C.15 D.20

Slide 23: Answer & Explanation — Effect Size in Practice: ARR → NNT

- Correct Answer: 5
- Key Points:
  - Number needed to treat (NNT) is the number of patients who would need to be treated to prevent the
  - unwanted outcome. It is calculated as NTT = 1 / absolute risk reduction = 1 / risk
  - risk
  - .
- Visual suggestion: Worked example in a number line: Control 30% vs Treatment 10% → ARR=0.20 → NNT=5.

Slide 24: Clinical Question — Confidence Intervals: Meaning & Pitfalls

A researcher is reviewing a study on adolescents with celiac disease (CD). The goal of the study is to
  determine whether adherence to a gluten-free diet differs based on the method of diagnosis—endoscopic biopsy
  or serologic markers alone. The outcome measure is the serum tissue transglutaminase (TTG) level 1 year after
  diagnosis and initiation of the gluten-free diet. A serum immunoglobulin (Ig) A TTG value of less than 15 was
  selected as normal.  The results of the study show the mean TTG level 1 year after diagnosis and initiation of
  diet management in patients with celiac disease: Biopsy-conﬁrmed (95% conﬁdence interval) Serology-conﬁrmed
  (95% conﬁdence interval) TTG 15 U/mL (10-20 U/mL) 30 U/mL (18-42 U/mL) Of the following, the BEST
  interpretation of these results is that A.95% of the subjects with biopsy-confirmed CD had TTG levels between
  10 and 20 B.there is 95% certainty that the mean TTG level for serology-confirmed CD in the population would
  be between 18 and 42* C.there is 95% likelihood that the TTG levels of biopsy-confirmed and serology-confirmed
  patients with CD were significantly different D.there is a 95% probability that all serology-confirmed CD
  patients in the population will have TTG levels between 18 and 42

Slide 25: Answer & Explanation — Confidence Intervals: Meaning & Pitfalls

- Correct Answer: there is 95% certainty that the mean TTG level for serology-confirmed CD in the
- Key Points:
  - Confidence intervals are routinely set at 90%, 95%, or 99%, indicating the percent certainty that the
  - true effect (ie, population mean) falls within the interval.
  - Confidence intervals (CIs) inform the reader about the precision of the estimates. Narrow CIs are
  - typically seen when the sample size is large, because the standard deviations decrease as the sample
- Visual suggestion: Two group means with 95% CI bars; show overlapping and non‑overlapping cases; warn about misinterpretation.

Slide 26: Part 5: Time‑to‑Event Outcomes

Slide 27: Clinical Question — Time‑to‑Event Outcomes: Kaplan–Meier & Censoring

A researcher is designing a study on how long it takes Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) IgG-negative pediatric
  transplant recipients to convert to EBV IgG-positive status after receiving a kidney from an EBV-positive
  donor. There will be 2 groups; one receives a 90-day course of antiviral therapy after transplant and another
  receives a 365-day course of antiviral therapy after transplant. Of the following, the BEST statistical
  approach is A.1-way analysis of variance B.survival analysis * C.t test D. χ2 test

Slide 28: Answer & Explanation — Time‑to‑Event Outcomes: Kaplan–Meier & Censoring

- Correct Answer: survival analysis
- Key Points:
  - Kaplan
  - Meier survival analysis is a great way to visually depict outcomes over time.
  - Additional analysis beyond the survival curve is required to determine whether a statistical difference
  - is present.
- Visual suggestion: Kaplan–Meier step plot with censoring ticks; callout: log‑rank tests entire curves.

Slide 29: Wrap‑Up & Take‑Home

- Reliability ≠ Validity—know which claim your study is making
- p‑values show data compatibility with H₀; report effect sizes
- Plan for power; low power inflates false‑negatives
- Match the test to the data: ANOVA (>2 means), χ² (proportions)
- Report ARR/NNT and 95% CIs for clinical meaning
- Use survival analysis when outcomes unfold over time
