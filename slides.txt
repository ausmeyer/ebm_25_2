Slide 4: Question 1

-   Title: Question 1: Variable Types

-   Content:

  A physician has been collecting data on adolescent patientsâ€™ body mass
  indices (BMIs). The physician is now trying to determine whether BMI
  is associated with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. It is
  hypothesized that there should be an association because higher BMIs
  are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and because people with
  uncontrolled diabetes mellitus have elevated HbA1c levels. The
  physician has collected data on 300 patients over the past 6 months.

  <br>

  <br>

  Of the following, the variable type that BEST describes BMI and HbA1c
  is:

  A. continuous

  B. discrete

  C. nominal

  D. ordinal

Slide 5: Answer & Explanation 1

-   Title: Answer 1: Continuous Variables

-   Correct Answer: A. continuous

-   Explanation (Bulleted List):

    -   Continuous variables can theoretically take on an infinite
        number of values between any two points.

    -   Both BMI and HbA1c are measured, not counted. They can be
        carried out to many decimal places depending on the precision of
        the measurement instrument (e.g., a BMI of 22.5 or 22.51).

    -   This is distinct from discrete variables, which are counted in
        whole numbers (e.g., number of children).

    -   Key Takeaway: If a variable is measured on a scale with
        potentially infinite values, it's continuous.

Slide 6: Alternative Answers 1

-   Title: When Would Other Answers Be Correct?

-   Content:

    -   B. discrete: This would be correct if the variable was something
        you count in whole numbers.

        -   Example: "Number of cigarettes smoked per day," "Number of
            hospital admissions," or "Number of seizures in a month."
            These variables have a finite number of possible values.

    -   C. nominal: This would be correct if the variable represented
        categories with no inherent order or rank.

        -   Example: "Blood Type (A, B, AB, O)," "Patient's City of
            Residence," or "Hair Color." You can't say that 'Type O' is
            mathematically greater than 'Type A'.

    -   D. ordinal: This would be correct if the variable represented
        categories with a meaningful order, but the intervals between
        them are not equal.

        -   Example: A pain scale (1-10), a Likert scale ("Strongly
            Disagree" to "Strongly Agree"), or cancer staging (Stage I,
            II, III, IV).

Slide 7: Question 2

-   Title: Question 2: Categorizing Data

-   Content:

  A researcher is designing a clinical trial and developing the data
  collection forms. The researcher wants to collect information
  regarding household income, and, instead of leaving a blank area for
  the participant to report their income, the researcher provides the
  following choices: less than $50,000, $50,000 to $75,000, $75,001 to
  $100,000, and greater than $100,000.

  <br>

  <br>

  Of the following, the BEST way to describe this income variable is:

  A. continuous variable

  B. dichotomous variable

  C. nominal variable

  D. ordinal variable

Slide 8: Answer & Explanation 2

-   Title: Answer 2: Ordinal Variable

-   Correct Answer: D. ordinal variable

-   Explanation (Bulleted List):

    -   The variable is broken into categories that have a clear,
        meaningful order or hierarchy (less than $50k < $50k-$75k <
        etc.).

    -   However, the intervals between the categories are not equal. The
        "less than $50,000" category is an open-ended range, as is
        "greater than $100,000."

    -   This conversion of a continuous variable (exact income) into
        ordered categories is a common practice for simplifying data
        collection and analysis.

    -   Key Takeaway: If data is in ordered categories, it's an ordinal
        variable.

Slide 9: Alternative Answers 2

-   Title: When Would Other Answers Be Correct?

-   Content:

    -   A. continuous variable: This would be correct if the researcher
        had asked participants to write in their exact household income
        (e.g., "$81,100.16").

    -   B. dichotomous variable: This is a specific type of categorical
        variable with only two possible outcomes. This would be correct
        if the choices were simply "Income below $75,000" and "Income
        $75,000 or above."

    -   C. nominal variable: This would be correct if the categories had
        no logical order. For example, if the question was "What is your
        primary source of income?" with categories like "Wages,"
        "Investments," "Retirement," "Self-Employment."

Slide 10: Question 3

-   Title: Question 3: Central Tendency

-   Content:

  A hospitalist is working on a quality improvement project related to
  bronchiolitis. A team member has proposed an intervention package that
  they believe will reduce length of stay by 25%. The hospitalist is
  gathering length-of-stay data from the past 3 bronchiolitis seasons to
  set the baseline metric for the project. The histogram and descriptive
  statistics are shown in Figure 1.

  <br>

  <br>

  Of the following, the MOST accurate assessment of the baseline data is
  that:

  A. the large number of outliers precludes accurate estimation of
  length of stay

  B. the mean is the most appropriate measure of length of stay

  C. the median is the most appropriate measure of length of stay

  D. there is a 95% certainty that the true mean is between 30 and 88
  hours

-   Visualization Note for Production Team:

    -   Create a histogram titled "Distribution of Hospital Length of
        Stay (Hours)".

    -   X-axis: "Length of Stay (Hours)".

    -   Y-axis: "Number of Patients (Frequency)".

    -   Distribution: The data must be clearly right-skewed. Show a
        large cluster of bars at the low end (e.g., between 24-96 hours)
        and a long, low tail extending far to the right, with a few very
        small bars at high values (e.g., 400, 500 hours).

    -   Annotations: Add two vertical lines to the plot. One labeled
        "Median" at the peak of the cluster, and another labeled "Mean"
        pulled to the right of the median, into the tail of the
        distribution.

Slide 11: Answer & Explanation 3

-   Title: Answer 3: Median for Skewed Data

-   Correct Answer: C. the median is the most appropriate measure of
    length of stay

-   Explanation (Bulleted List):

    -   The histogram shows right-skewed data, meaning there are a few
        very high values (outliers) that pull the tail to the right.

    -   The mean (the average) is highly sensitive to outliers. These
        few extremely long hospital stays will artificially inflate the
        mean, making it a poor representation of a "typical" patient's
        stay.

    -   The median (the middle value) is resistant to outliers. It
        represents the 50th percentile, providing a much better measure
        of central tendency for skewed datasets.

    -   Key Takeaway: For skewed data, always prefer the median over the
        mean. Mean is for normally distributed (symmetric) data.

Slide 12: Alternative Answers 3

-   Title: When Would Other Answers Be Correct?

-   Content:

    -   A. the large number of outliers precludes accurate
        estimation...: This is incorrect. While outliers complicate
        analysis, they don't make it impossible. Using robust statistics
        like the median allows for an accurate estimation of the central
        tendency.

    -   B. the mean is the most appropriate measure...: This would be
        correct if the histogram showed a symmetric, bell-shaped
        (normal) distribution. In that case, the mean and median would
        be nearly identical and either would be appropriate.

    -   D. there is a 95% certainty that the true mean is between 30 and
        88 hours: This describes a 95% Confidence Interval. While this
        is a valid statistical concept, we cannot determine its value
        from the information given in the question, and it doesn't
        address the primary issue of choosing the best measure of
        central tendency for this dataset.

Slide 13: Question 4

-   Title: Question 4: Describing Normal Data

-   Content:

  Data obtained on elements of the complete blood count in 2- to
  24-month-old infants and children with viral infections are being
  compared with data in those with confirmed bacterial infection.

  <br>

  <br>

  Of the following, and assuming continuous variables and a normal
  distribution, the measure of central tendency that yields the BEST
  descriptive information for evaluating the components of the complete
  blood count in this study is:

  A. mean

  B. median

  C. mode

  D. range

Slide 14: Answer & Explanation 4

-   Title: Answer 4: Mean for Normal Data

-   Correct Answer: A. mean

-   Explanation (Bulleted List):

    -   The question explicitly states two key conditions: the variables
        are continuous (like WBC count, hemoglobin) and they follow a
        normal distribution.

    -   For normally distributed (symmetric, bell-shaped) data, the
        mean, median, and mode are all equal.

    -   The mean is the conventional and most powerful measure of
        central tendency for normal distributions because it uses every
        data point in its calculation.

    -   Key Takeaway: When you see "normal distribution," think "mean."

Slide 15: Alternative Answers 4

-   Title: When Would Other Answers Be Correct?

-   Content:

    -   B. median: This would be the best choice if the data were
        skewed, as we saw in the previous question.

    -   C. mode: This is the most frequent value. It's most useful for
        nominal (categorical) data. For example, to describe the most
        common blood type in a sample. It is rarely the best measure for
        continuous data.

    -   D. range: This is a measure of dispersion or spread (Max - Min),
        not central tendency. It tells you how spread out the data is,
        but not where the center is. It would be used alongside the mean
        to describe the data, but it is not a measure of the center
        itself.

Slide 16: Question 5

-   Title: Question 5: Standard Deviation

-   Content:

  An 11-year-old boy is experiencing unexplained weight loss... At his
  visit this year, he has lost 3.63 kg (8.00 lb). His current height and
  weight are shown in Figure 1.

  <br>

  <br>

  Of the following, assuming weights are distributed normally, this
  boyâ€™s weight falls:

  A. 1 to 2 standard deviations from the mean

  B. 2 to 3 standard deviations from the mean

  C. greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean

  D. less than 1 standard deviation from the mean

-   Visualization Note for Production Team:

    -   Create a standard Weight-for-Age growth chart for boys.

    -   X-axis: "Age (Years)", marked up to 11.

    -   Y-axis: "Weight (kg)".

    -   Curves: Draw and label the standard percentile curves: 3rd,
        16th, 50th, 84th, 97th.

    -   Annotations:

        -   Next to the 50th percentile curve, label it "Mean".

        -   Next to the 16th and 84th percentile curves, label them "Â±1
            SD".

        -   Next to the 3rd and 97th percentile curves, label them "Â±2
            SD".

    -   Data Point: Place a large, visible dot on the chart at Age = 11,
        positioned on the 5th percentile curve. This will visually place
        it between the 3rd percentile (-2 SD) and the 16th percentile
        (-1 SD).

Slide 17: Answer & Explanation 5

-   Title: Answer 5: Interpreting Standard Deviations

-   Correct Answer: A. 1 to 2 standard deviations from the mean

-   Explanation (Bulleted List):

    -   For normally distributed data (like growth charts):

        -   The 50th percentile represents the mean.

        -   Â±1 SD from the mean covers ~68% of the population (from the
            16th to the 84th percentile).

        -   Â±2 SD from the mean covers ~95% of the population (from the
            3rd to the 97th percentile).

    -   The vignette states the boy's weight is at the 5th percentile.

    -   The 5th percentile falls between the 3rd percentile (-2 SD) and
        the 16th percentile (-1 SD).

    -   Therefore, his weight is between 1 and 2 standard deviations
        below the mean.

Slide 18: Alternative Answers 5

-   Title: When Would Other Answers Be Correct?

-   Content:

    -   B. 2 to 3 standard deviations from the mean: This would be
        correct if his weight was extremely low, falling between the 3rd
        percentile (~ -2 SD) and the 0.1st percentile (~ -3 SD).

    -   C. greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean: This would
        be correct for a truly extreme value, either very high (>99.9th
        percentile) or very low (<0.1st percentile).

    -   D. less than 1 standard deviation from the mean: This would be
        correct if his weight was closer to average, for example, at the
        25th percentile (which falls between the 16th and 50th
        percentiles).

Slide 19: Part 2 Title Slide

-   Title: Part 2: Foundational Epidemiology & Diagnostic Testing

Slide 20: Question 6

-   Title: Question 6: Prevalence vs. Incidence

-   Content:

  A screening program conducted at a high school is screening student
  athletes with electrocardiography to identify undiagnosed heart
  disease. Of 1,000 students, 2 students are found to have a prolonged
  QT interval.

  <br>

  <br>

  Of the following, the parameter of long QT syndrome that can BEST be
  calculated by these data is the:

  A. incidence

  B. odds ratio

  C. prevalence

  D. relative risk

Slide 21: Answer & Explanation 6

-   Title: Answer 6: Prevalence

-   Correct Answer: C. prevalence

-   Explanation (Bulleted List):

    -   Prevalence is a snapshot in time. It measures the number of
        existing cases (both new and old) in a defined population at a
        single point in time.

    -   The study screened 1,000 students and found 2 cases. This is a
        snapshot.

    -   Prevalence = (Number of existing cases) / (Total population) = 2
        / 1000.

    -   Incidence, by contrast, measures new cases that develop over a
        period of time. To measure incidence, you would need to follow
        the 998 healthy students over time to see who develops the
        condition.

    -   Key Takeaway: Prevalence = Snapshot. Incidence = Movie.

Slide 22: Alternative Answers 6

-   Title: When Would Other Answers Be Correct?

-   Content:

    -   A. incidence: This would be correct if the study stated: "We
        followed 1,000 initially healthy athletes for one year, and
        during that year, 2 athletes developed long QT syndrome for the
        first time."

    -   B. odds ratio: This is a measure of association, typically from
        a case-control study. You would need two groups (e.g., students
        with long QT and students without) and you would compare the
        odds of a certain exposure (e.g., family history) between the
        two groups.

    -   D. relative risk: This is a measure of association, typically
        from a cohort study. You would need to follow two groups over
        time (e.g., one group exposed to a risk factor, one group not
        exposed) and compare the incidence of the disease in each group.

Slide 23: Question 7

-   Title: Question 7: Calculating Incidence

-   Content:

  A recent article described the epidemiology of celiac disease in an
  inner-city community. The study evaluated a city with 50,000 children
  without celiac disease at the start of the study. At the end of the
  5-year period, the following number of children were diagnosed with
  celiac disease.

-   Year 1: 5 New Celiac Cases

-   Year 2: 5 New Celiac Cases

-   Year 3: 5 New Celiac Cases

-   Year 4: 10 New Celiac Cases

-   Year 5: 10 New Celiac Cases

  <br>**Of the following, the annual INCIDENCE rate of celiac disease
  per 100,000 patients in this study is:**A. 5B. 7C. 14D. 35

Slide 24: Answer & Explanation 7

-   Title: Answer 7: Calculating Annual Incidence

-   Correct Answer: C. 14

-   Explanation (Step-by-Step Calculation):

    1.  Find the total number of new cases:

        -   5 + 5 + 5 + 10 + 10 = 35 new cases over 5 years.

    2.  Find the average number of new cases per year:

        -   35 cases / 5 years = 7 new cases per year.

    3.  Calculate the annual incidence rate:

        -   (Average new cases per year) / (Population at risk)

        -   7 / 50,000 = 0.00014

    4.  Convert the rate to "per 100,000" as requested:

        -   0.00014 * 100,000 = 14 per 100,000.

Slide 25: Alternative Answers 7

-   Title: How You Might Get the Wrong Answer

-   Content:

    -   A. 5: This is the number of new cases in Year 1, not the average
        annual rate.

    -   B. 7: This is the correct average number of new cases per year,
        but it is not the rate per 100,000. This is a common mistake of
        stopping the calculation too early.

    -   D. 35: This is the total number of new cases over the entire
        5-year period, not the annual rate.

Slide 26: Question 8

-   Title: Question 8: Sensitivity

-   Content:

  An infant is admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock...
  A recent study presented the following information: among 200 children
  admitted with septic shock, 100 developed acute kidney injury. Of
  those who developed acute kidney injury, the test was positive in 70
  children. However, the test was also positive in 10 children who did
  not develop acute kidney injury.

  <br>

  <br>

  Of the following, based on these results, the SENSITIVITY of the new
  blood test for detecting acute kidney injury is:

  A. 10%

  B. 30%

  C. 70%

  D. 90%

Slide 27: Answer & Explanation 8

-   Title: Answer 8: Calculating Sensitivity

-   Correct Answer: C. 70%

-   Explanation:

    -   Sensitivity answers the question: "Of all the people who
        actually have the disease, what percentage test positive?"

    -   Formula: Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False
        Negatives)

-   Let's break down the numbers:

    -   Total patients with AKI (Disease Present) = 100

    -   Test positive in those with AKI (True Positives) = 70

    -   This means 30 patients with AKI must have tested negative (False
        Negatives = 100 - 70).

-   Calculation:

    -   Sensitivity = 70 / (70 + 30) = 70 / 100 = 70%

-   Visualization Note for Production Team:

    -   Create a 2x2 contingency table.

    -   Columns: "Has AKI (Disease)", "No AKI (Healthy)".

    -   Rows: "Test Positive", "Test Negative".

    -   Fill in the cells:

        -   True Positive (Has AKI, Test +): 70

        -   False Positive (No AKI, Test +): 10

        -   False Negative (Has AKI, Test -): 30

        -   True Negative (No AKI, Test -): 90

    -   Highlight the "Has AKI" column to show that sensitivity is
        calculated only from this group.

Slide 28: Alternative Answers 8

-   Title: What Do the Other Numbers Represent?

-   Content:

  Using the data from the previous slide:

-   A. 10%: This is the False Positive Rate (10 False Positives / 100
    Healthy Patients).

-   B. 30%: This is the False Negative Rate (30 False Negatives / 100
    Patients with AKI).

-   D. 90%: This is the Specificity of the test. Specificity answers:
    "Of all the people who are healthy, what percentage test negative?"

    -   Calculation: True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives)
        = 90 / (90 + 10) = 90 / 100 = 90%.

Slide 29: Question 9

-   Title: Question 9: Sensitivity & Specificity

-   Content:

  A research article describes a potential new serum screening test for
  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). One hundred children are recruited...

-   Of the 25 with EoE, the screening test was positive in 20 and
    negative in 5.

-   Of the 75 without EoE, the screening test was negative in 65 and
    positive in 10.

  <br>**Of the following, the sensitivity and specificity of the
  screening test are:**A. Sensitivity 20.0%, Specificity 75.0%B.
  Sensitivity 80.0%, Specificity 86.7%C. Sensitivity 80.0%, Specificity
  25.0%D. Sensitivity 20.0%, Specificity 25.0%

Slide 30: Answer & Explanation 9

-   Title: Answer 9: Calculating Both

-   Correct Answer: B. Sensitivity 80.0%, Specificity 86.7%

-   Visualization: A 2x2 Table is Essential Here

+-------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+
| -                 | Has EoE (Disease)       | No EoE (Healthy)       |
+===================+:=======================:+:======================:+
| Test Positive     | 20 (TP)                 | 10 (FP)                |

| Test Negative     | 5 (FN)                  | 65 (TN)                |
+-------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+

-   Calculations:

    -   Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)

        -   = 20 / (20 + 5) = 20 / 25 = 80.0%

    -   Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)

        -   = 65 / (65 + 10) = 65 / 75 = 86.7%

-   Teaching Point: Note that even peer-reviewed source material can
    have typos. Always perform the calculations yourself to verify the
    results.

-   Content:

  The health editor of a parenting magazine inquires about a study that
  was recently published... The study examined the relationship between
  toddler thumb-sucking and later food allergy.

  <br>

  <br>

  Of the following, based on the provided scatterplot (Figure 1), the
  MOST appropriate conclusion to draw from this study is that
  thumb-sucking:

  A. is associated with a lower incidence of food allergy

  B. is a result of food allergy

  C. is unrelated to the incidence of food allergy

  D. lowers the incidence of food allergy

-   Visualization Note for Production Team:

    -   Create a scatterplot titled "Relationship Between Thumb-Sucking
        and Food Allergies".

    -   X-axis: "Months of Thumb-Sucking".

    -   Y-axis: "Number of Diagnosed Food Allergies".

    -   Data Points: Plot numerous dots that show a clear negative
        correlation. The cloud of points should trend from the
        upper-left to the lower-right.

    -   Trend Line: Draw a line of best fit through the data points.
        This line must have a clear downward (negative) slope.

Slide 33: Answer & Explanation 10

-   Title: Answer 10: Association is Not Causation

-   Correct Answer: A. is associated with a lower incidence of food
    allergy

-   Explanation (Bulleted List):

    -   The scatterplot shows a clear relationship: as the months of
        thumb-sucking increase, the number of food allergies tends to
        decrease. This is a negative correlation.

    -   Association and correlation are appropriate terms to describe
        this relationship. We can say the two variables are linked.

    -   However, this study design cannot prove causation. We don't know
        if thumb-sucking causes a lower incidence of allergies. There
        could be a confounding variable (e.g., exposure to microbes,
        genetics, socioeconomic factors) that influences both behaviors.

    -   Key Takeaway: The most important phrase in statistics:
        Correlation does not imply causation.

Slide 34: Alternative Answers 10

-   Title: Why the Other Conclusions Are Wrong

-   Content:

    -   B. is a result of food allergy: This reverses the potential
        causal pathway with no evidence. It's an unsupported causal
        claim.

    -   C. is unrelated to the incidence of food allergy: This is
        factually incorrect. The scatterplot clearly shows a
        relationship (a negative correlation). If it were unrelated, the
        data points would be scattered randomly with no discernible
        trend.

    -   D. lowers the incidence of food allergy: This is a causal claim.
        The word "lowers" implies that thumb-sucking is the active agent
        causing the effect. While this might be a hypothesis for a
        future study (like a randomized controlled trial), this
        observational data cannot support this strong conclusion.
